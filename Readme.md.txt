LabVIEW Object-Oriented State Machine

This project is my intepretation of the State Pattern by Gang of Four, implemented in LabVIEW.

I wanted to translate the State Pattern UML Diagram into LabVIEW Code and as a result, implement an OOP State Machine. 

To validade that it works exactly as a state Machine, I designed an Exmaple Application which mimics the Simple State Machine Sample project.

My Next Steps would be Queueing States and Developing an Application Example Reference.
